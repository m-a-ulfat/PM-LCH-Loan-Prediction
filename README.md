# PM-LCH Loan Prediction

![Project Logo](Logo.jpeg)

## 📌 Overview
The **PM-LCH Loan Prediction** project is a Machine Learning solution developed to assist in predicting loan approval status for applicants under the **Prime Minister's Low-Cost Housing Scheme (PM-LCH)**.  
This project uses applicant details such as income, loan amount, credit history, and other relevant factors to predict whether a loan should be **approved** or **denied**.

## 🎯 Objective
To create a reliable, data-driven model that:
- Helps financial institutions make quick and accurate decisions.
- Minimizes the risk of loan defaults.
- Supports the PM-LCH initiative by streamlining loan approvals.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **CatBoost** (Machine Learning Model)
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** (Data Processing)
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** (Visualization)
- **Tkinter** (GUI for user-friendly predictions)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Development & Testing)

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Data Collection** – Data is gathered from loan applicants.
2. **Data Cleaning** – Missing values and outliers are handled.
3. **Feature Engineering** – Important features are selected and transformed.
4. **Model Training** – CatBoost is used for high-accuracy predictions.
5. **GUI Application** – A Tkinter-based GUI allows non-technical staff to make predictions easily.

## 📊 Model Performance
- **Accuracy:** 85–90% (depending on dataset variations)
- **Algorithm Used:** CatBoost Classifier
